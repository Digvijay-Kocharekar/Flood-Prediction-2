      <h2>About Flash Floods</h2>
      <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;">
        This system aims to predict flash floods in various parts of our country by learning from past data. The user will input parameters such as location, expected rainfall, water levels in nearby reservoirs etc. and the system will give the probability of flash floods in the region in the upcoming few days. A large database of flash flood events consisting of more than 14 000 events are assessed for training and testing the methodology, while a multitude of data sources are utilised to acquire reliable information related to each event. A variable selection approach was employed to alleviate the complexity of the dataset and facilitate the model development process.
        This study is among the few efforts for predicting flash flood damage across a large domain using mesoscale input variables, and the findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The societal impacts of flash floods are more significant than any other weather-related hazard. They are often manifested in the form of infrastructure damage, flooding roadways and bridges, creating deadly hazards to motorists and inundation of crops and pasture. For instance, the flash floods in Mumbai that occurred on 26th July 2005 caused heavy amount of damage to human life and property. The floods were caused by the eighth heaviest-ever recorded 24-hour rainfall figure of 944 mm (37.17 inches) which lashed the metropolis on 26 July 2005, and intermittently continued for the next day. 644mm (25.35 inches) was received within the 12-hour period between 8 am and 8 pm. Torrential rainfall continued for the next week. The highest 24-hour period in India was 1,168 mm (46.0 inches) in Aminidivi in the Union Territory of Lakshadweep on 6 May 2004 although some reports suggest that it was a new Indian record. The previous record high rainfall in a 24-hour period for Mumbai was 575 mm (22.6 inches) in 1974. Some of these hazards can be anticipated and thus mitigated given effective warning systems. This project describes the tools proposed over recent decades in India to predict flash flooding and evaluates them using a common observational data set. Design recommendations for flash-flood forecasting systems are provided, taking into account today's availability of high-resolution rainfall data at scales commensurate with flash flooding, their archives, spatial data sets to describe physiographic properties, and ever-increasing computational resources.
